# java_project

By Christian Von Eper

this project is to make a "snake game". 
it will be similar to the traditional 2d snake game where you navigate as a snake to eat food, but be careful not to run into walls or yourself.

the goal is to create a fun to play snake game in java, and be able to share it with others 

:D
